### Key Features:

1. **To-Do Scheduler:**
   Stay on top of your game by compiling a list of tasks with the To-Do Scheduler. Create, edit, and manage your to-do lists effortlessly, ensuring you stay focused on what matters most.

2. **Video Games & Movies List:**
   Keep tabs on your favorite games and movies. LifeSync's Video Games & Movies List lets you track what you've watched or played – it's completely up to the user! The list can contain your favorite games and movies or ones you hope to play or see in the future!

3. **Finance Manager:**
   Take control of your finances – because every penny counts. With the Finance Manager, you can track expenses into two categories: subscriptions and one-time payments you have or want to have! Having that laid out in front of you will give you a better idea of how much money you are spending.

4. **Nutrition Manager:**
   Keep track of your favorite foods and their nutritional facts! You decide the serving size and log the calories, sodium levels, and sugar levels. Having logged that food you can make the decision whether that food falls within your limit for whatever day you want to eat a meal!
